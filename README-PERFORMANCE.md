6. **Optimized i18n Configuration**
   - Added performance-focused settings to i18next
   - Disabled unnecessary re-renders
   - File modified: `src/i18n.ts`

7. **Created Optimized Data Table Component**
   - Added memoization for data and columns
   - Implemented debounced search
   - Throttled pagination actions
   - File added: `src/components/inventory/optimized-data-table.tsx`

8. **Added Performance Monitoring Utilities**
   - Created tools to track component render times
   - Added utilities to identify slow components
   - File added: `src/lib/performance-monitor.ts`

## Additional Performance Optimization Tips

### React Component Optimization

1. **Use React.memo for Pure Components**
   ```jsx
   const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
     // Your component code
   });
   ```

2. **Use useMemo for Expensive Calculations**
   ```jsx
   const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
   ```

3. **Use useCallback for Event Handlers**
   ```jsx
   const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
     doSomething(a, b);
   }, [a, b]);
   ```

4. **Virtualize Long Lists**
   - Use `react-window` or `react-virtualized` for long lists
   - Only render items that are visible in the viewport

### Data Fetching Optimization

1. **Implement Caching**
   - Cache API responses to reduce redundant network requests
   - Use SWR or React Query for automatic caching and revalidation

2. **Paginate Data**
   - Fetch only the data needed for the current view
   - Implement infinite scrolling or pagination

3. **Optimize Supabase Queries**
   - Select only the columns you need
   - Use appropriate indexes
   - Limit the number of rows returned

### Animation Optimization

1. **Use CSS Transitions Instead of JavaScript When Possible**
   - CSS transitions are hardware-accelerated
   - They run on a separate thread from JavaScript

2. **Reduce Animation Complexity**
   - Animate only necessary properties (prefer opacity and transform)
   - Avoid animating layout properties (width, height, top, left)

3. **Use will-change CSS Property**
   - Hint to the browser which properties will change
   - Use sparingly to avoid memory issues

### Code Splitting

1. **Use Dynamic Imports**
   ```jsx
   const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));
   ```

2. **Split Code by Route**
   - Load only the code needed for the current route
   - Use React.lazy and Suspense

### Bundle Size Optimization

1. **Analyze Bundle Size**
   - Use tools like `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to identify large dependencies

2. **Tree Shake Unused Code**
   - Import only what you need from libraries
   - Use ES modules for better tree shaking

3. **Compress Assets**
   - Use appropriate image formats (WebP, AVIF)
   - Optimize SVGs
   - Compress CSS and JavaScript

## Monitoring Performance

Use the performance monitoring utilities in `src/lib/performance-monitor.ts` to identify slow components:

```jsx
import { usePerformanceMonitor } from '@/lib/performance-monitor';

function MyComponent() {
  usePerformanceMonitor('MyComponent');
  // Component code
}
```

Or use the higher-order component:

```jsx
import { withPerformanceMonitoring } from '@/lib/performance-monitor';

function MyComponent() {
  // Component code
}

export default withPerformanceMonitoring(MyComponent, 'MyComponent');
```

## Browser Developer Tools

Use browser developer tools to identify performance issues:

1. **Chrome Performance Tab**
   - Record performance during user interactions
   - Identify long tasks and rendering bottlenecks

2. **React DevTools Profiler**
   - Identify components that render too often
   - Measure render times

3. **Lighthouse**
   - Run audits to identify performance issues
   - Follow recommendations to improve performance
